Modified RTL-SDR Blog Version
*****************************

1) VCO PLL current fix - Improves stability at frequencies above ~1.5 GHz https://www.rtl-sdr.com/beta-testing-a-modified-rtl-sdr-driver-for-l-band-heat-issues/
2) RTL_TCP ring buffer enhancement by Stephen Blinick https://www.rtl-sdr.com/significantly-improving-rtl_tcps-performance-with-ring-buffers/
3) Enabled direct sampling for rtl_tcp
4) rtl_biast program added, including the ability to turn on/off any GPIO
5) Hack to force the bias tee to always be on by setting the unused IR endpoint bit to 0 in the EEPROM. Example to force the BT to be always ON "rtl_eeprom -b y", to remove forced BT "rtl_eeprom -b n"
6) Hack to force direct sampling to be always on by setting the unused remote-enabled bit to 1 in the EEPROM. Example to force direct samping always "rtl_eeprom -q y". To remove forced direct sampling "rtl_eeprom -q n"
7) Repurposed "offset tuning" to toggle bias tee ON/OFF. We can now use the "offset tuning" button in SDR# and other programs to toggle the bias tee if there is no specific button in the GUI.

BIAS TEE NOTE: Always take care that you do not enable the bias tee when the device is connected to a short circuited antenna unless there is an inline LNA. However. if you did by accident, don't worry as the circuit is dually protected with a self-resetting thermal fuse and built in protection on the LDO. Just try not to short it out for days at a time, otherwise you could eventually degrade the thermal fuse.

Installation (Linux):
********************

***NOTE***
If you previously installed librtlsdr-dev via the package manager you should remove this first BEFORE installing these drivers. To completely remove these drivers use the following commands

sudo apt purge librtlsdr*
sudo rm -rvf /usr/lib/librtlsdr* /usr/include/rtl-sdr* /usr/local/lib/librtlsdr* /usr/local/include/rtl-sdr*

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev git cmake
git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
cd rtl-sdr/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
make
sudo make install
sudo cp ../rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo ldconfig

echo 'blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu' | sudo tee --append /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-dvb_usb_rtl28xxu.conf

***********************
Installation (Windows):
***********************

Download the Release.zip file. Extract the rtlsdr.dll file to the SDR# folder, or whatever software is using it.
